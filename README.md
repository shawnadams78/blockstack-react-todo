# Blockstack React Todo

A Blockstack Todo app built with React. Intended to have feature parity with the Blockstack documentation example Todo app built with the Vue framework (https://docs.blockstack.org/browser/todo-list.html):

* Blockstack user authentication
* Gaia storage of todos
* Toggle "complete" status
* Delete completed todos

### Issues/TODO/Incomplete

* I ran into build issues trying to integrate both `styled-components` and `node-sass`, so in the interest of time I used vanilla CSS.
* There is some rudimentary responsiveness built into the layout, but additional work would be useful
* App icons/favicons

---

## Installation

* `yarn install`
* `yarn start`
